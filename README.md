# STOR390_FinalPaper

This repository contains files of my final paper for the course Stor390 at UNC Chapel Hill. It contains both my source code from r markdown and a pdf version of the paper.

This paper analyzes a research study titled "Food and Beverage Advertising to Children and Adolescents on Television: A Baseline Study" that was published in 2020. It analyzes the correlation between food and beverages ads on TV and obesity rates amongst children in Canada.
